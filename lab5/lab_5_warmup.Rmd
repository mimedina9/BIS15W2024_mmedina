fish
```
## 2. Set new data frame (fishlength) to include "lakeid" and "length"
```{r}
fishlength <- select(fish, "lakeid", "length")
fishlength
```
## 3. Filter fish data to include the samples from lake "BO"
```{r}
fish_BO <-filter(fish, lakeid=="BO")
```
## 4. Calculate mean of fish from BO
```{r}
mean(fish_BO$length)
```
